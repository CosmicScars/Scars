query in Search/ Advanced 

method:  run a query for every halp kpc from 4kpc to 50kpc in Gaia Archive (Gaia has 1.5 billion stars but online search returns only up to 3 million). For the study, at least 15000 every kpc is necessary.
method:  use astronomy.gaia lib in PY and access the ddbb directly though a free ESA account is needed.
